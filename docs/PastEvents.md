## May is Mental Health Awareness Month, May 1 - 31
This month, we recognize the need for mental health resources to our first reponders. RPSF and Police and Fire Unions have teamed up to help introduce FST5 Frontline Strong Together to our first responders. FST5 is a crisis and support resource for first responders and their families. Staffed by first responders trained as crisis specialists - people who **understand** duty challenges. They are available day and night.
