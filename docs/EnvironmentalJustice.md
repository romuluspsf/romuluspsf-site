# Environmental Justice Alert for Wayne County Residents

<hr style="border: none; height: 4px; background-color: #004080; margin: 2rem 0;" />

# STOP Radioactive Waste from Coming to our Communities
<i>Summary by Romulus Public Safety Foundation<i/>

<hr style="border: none; height: 4px; background-color: #004080; margin: 2rem 0;" />

# What's Happening?

Out-of-state radioactive waste is being trucked into <b>Wayne Dispoasl, Inc.,</b> a hazardous waste landfill located in <b>Van Buren Township,</b> just outside of <b>Romulus, Belleville,</b> and <b>Canton Township.</b> Waste has come from sites like Luckey, Ohio and New York linked to nucluear weapons production and pose a direct and substantial risk to the safety and health of the public and first responders in the City of Romulus and our neighboring communities.

# Why We're Speaking Out:

The <b>Romulus Public Safety Foundation</b> has filed an official <b>environmental justice complaint</b> with <b>EPA and Michigan EGLE</b> because the landfill's operations unfairly target minority and low-income communities in Wayne County. We are calling for an <b>immediate halt to radioactive waste shipments</b> and a full investigation.

<hr style="border: none; height: 4px; background-color: #004080; margin: 2rem 0;" />

# Who is Impacted?

Communities around the landfill are majority Black and minority, working-class residents. Here's the breakdown:
<ul>
  <li><b>Romulus:</b> 53.9% Black and minority residents, 11% poverty rate</li>
  <li><b>Van Buren Township:</b> 38.1% Black and minority residents, 11.4% poverty rate</li>
  <li><b>Wayne County:</b> 51.7% Black and minority residents, 20.1% overall poverty rate</li>
</ul>

These communities exceed state averages for racial minorities and areas surrounding the site are classified as disadvantaged, placing them at higher environmental vulnerability. This is <b>environmental racism</b> - our communities bear the burden while wealthier areas stay protected.

## The Evidence:

<ul>
  <li><b>Wayne County has 6 of Michigan's 8 hazardous waste sites</b></li>
  <li><b>94% of out-of-state waste in Michigan ends up here</b></li>
  <li>The area ranks in the <b>98th percentile</b> for environmental risk in the state</li>
  <li>Radioactive materials can impact air, soil, and <b>our drinking water</b></li>
</ul>

<hr style="border: none; height: 4px; background-color: #004080; margin: 2rem 0;" />

## What We're Demanding:

 <ol type="<b>1</b>">
  <li><b>Stop the radioactive shipments - immediately</b></li>
  <li><b>Launch a civil rights and environmental justice investigation</b></li>
  <li><b>Conduct a full health & pollution impact study</b></li>
  <li><b>Hold accessible, transparent public hearings</b></li>
  <li><b>Involve local communities in all future decisions</b></li> 
</ol>
