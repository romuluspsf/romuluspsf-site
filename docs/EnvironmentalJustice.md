# Environmental Justice Alert for Wayne County Residents

<i>Summary by Romulus Public Safety Foundation<i/>

# What's Happening?

Out-of-stae radioactive waste is being trucked into <b>Wayne Dispoasl, Inc.,</b> a hazardous waste landfill located in  <b>Van Buren Township,</b> just outside of <b>Romulus, Belleville,</b> and <b>Canton Township.</b> Waste has come from sites like Luckey, Ohio and New York linked to nucluear weapons production.

# Why We're Speaking Out:
