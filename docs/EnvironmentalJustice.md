# Environmental Justice Alert for Wayne County Residents

<hr style="border: none; height: 4px; background-color: #004080; margin: 2rem 0;" />

# STOP Radioactive Waste from Coming to our Communities
<i>Summary by Romulus Public Safety Foundation<i/>

<hr style="border: none; height: 4px; background-color: #004080; margin: 2rem 0;" />

# What's Happening?

Out-of-state radioactive waste is being trucked into <b>Wayne Dispoasl, Inc.,</b> a hazardous waste landfill located in <b>Van Buren Township,</b> just outside of <b>Romulus, Belleville,</b> and <b>Canton Township.</b> Waste has come from sites like Luckey, Ohio and New York linked to nucluear weapons production and pose a direct and substantial risk to the safety and health of the public and first responders in the City of Romulus and our neighboring communities.

<hr style="border: none; height: 4px; background-color: #004080; margin: 2rem 0;" />

# Why We're Speaking Out:

The <b>Romulus Public Safety Foundation</b> has filed an official <b>environmental justice complaint</b> with <b>EPA and Michigan EGLE</b> because the landfill's operations unfairly target minority and low-income communities in Wayne County. We are calling for an <b>immediate halt to radioactive waste shipments</b> and a full investigation.

<hr style="border: none; height: 4px; background-color: #004080; margin: 2rem 0;" />

# Who is Impacted?

Communities around the landfill are majority Black and minority, working-class residents. Here's the breakdown:
<ul>
  <li><b>Romulus:</b> 53.9% Black and minority residents, 11% poverty rate</li>
  <li><b>Van Buren Township:</b> 38.1% Black and minority residents, 11.4% poverty rate</li>
  <li><b>Wayne County:</b> 51.7% Black and minority residents, 20.1% overall poverty rate</li>
</ul>

These communities exceed state averages for racial minorities and areas surrounding the site are classified as disadvantaged, placing them at higher environmental vulnerability. This is <b>environmental racism</b> - our communities bear the burden while wealthier areas stay protected.

## The Evidence:

<ul>
  <li><b>Wayne County has 6 of Michigan's 8 hazardous waste sites</b></li>
  <li><b>94% of out-of-state waste in Michigan ends up here</b></li>
  <li>The area ranks in the <b>98th percentile</b> for environmental risk in the state</li>
  <li>Radioactive materials can impact air, soil, and <b>our drinking water</b></li>
</ul>

## What We're Demanding:

 <ol type="<b>1</b>">
  <li><b>Stop the radioactive shipments - immediately</b></li>
  <li><b>Launch a civil rights and environmental justice investigation</b></li>
  <li><b>Conduct a full health & pollution impact study</b></li>
  <li><b>Hold accessible, transparent public hearings</b></li>
  <li><b>Involve local communities in all future decisions</b></li> 
</ol>

## Official Statement: Why the Romulus Public Safety Foundation is Taking Action on Radioactive Waste and Environmental Justice

The <b>Romulus Public Safety Foundation (RPSF)</b> was established to support the strength, safety, and well-being of our city's public safety divisions - including our <b>police, fire and emergency response personnel</b> - and to advocate for the <b>health and protection of the residents they serve.</b>

Today, we face a public safety threat that goes beyond crime or natural disaster. The contiued approval and disposal of <b>radioactive and hazardous waste</b> from outside Michigan into Wayne County - and specifically in close proximity to the City of Romulus - poses a <b>clear and direct danger to first responders, families, and the long-term resilience of our community.</b>

We believe this issue falls squarely within our mission for the following reasons:
 
 <ol type="<b>1</b>">
  <li><b>Public Safety Risks:</b>
  Our first responders may be called to respond to incidents involving hazardous waste spills, contamination, or facility emergencies. Continued radioactive waste operations increase exposure risks, reduce emergency response capacity, and strain local resources that are already stretched thin</li>
   
  <li><b>Environmental Justice and Health Equity:</b>
  The residents of Romulus and surrounding communities already face some of the <b>hightest environmental burdens</b> in the state. The disproportionate placement of hazardous waste sites in majority-Black and minority and working-class communities constitutes a <b>civil rights concern</b> and violates the principles of <b>equal protection and public health justice.</b></li>
  <li><b>Emergency Preparedness:</b>
  True public safety begins with <b>prevention.</b> Advocacy to stop the expansion or continuation of radioactive waste disposal is a form of <b>preventative emergency management,</b> which directly supports the safety and sustainability of our local infrastructure and public health systems.</li>
  <li><b>Responsibility to Speak Out:</b>
  If our Foundation, in partnership with public safety officials, does not raise the alarm about these risks, <b>who will?</b> We owe it to our residents and our frontline professionals to demand accountability, transparency, and safer environmental policies.</li>
</ol> 

The Romulus Public Safety Foundation will continue to engage with residents, officials, and partner agencies to advocate for an end to the shipment of radioactive waste into our region. We urge the state and federal government to consider the full implications of these decisions - not only for the environment, but for the <b>health, safety, and dignity of every family and first responder in our community.</b>

## "We are not Michigan's dumping ground. We are families, workers, and children who deserve clean air, safe water, and a healthy future."
