## National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week
**Date:** April 13 - 19, 2025
This week, we proudly celebrate National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week! Behind every emergency response is a calm, steady voice guiding the way - our Romulus dispatchers. These dedicated professionals are the first point of contact in a crisis, providing life-saving support before help even arrives. They are unseen heroes, working 24/7 to keep our community safe.
**Romulus Public Safety Foundation** extends our heartfelt gratitude for our public safety dispatchers. Their service, strength, and sacrifice do not go unnoticed.

Thank a dispatcher today for being the calm in the chaos.

## May is Mental Healt Awareness Month
**Date:** May 1 - 31, 2025
This month, we recognize the need for mental health resources to our first reponders. RPSF and Police and Fire Unions have teamed up to help introduce FST5 Frontline Strong Together to our first responders. FST5 is a crisis and support resource for first responders and their families. Staffed by first responders trained as crisis specialists - people who **understand** duty challenges. They are available day and night.

**If you are experiencing any crisis - work related, substance abuse, depression, relationships, financial or any other, reach out by calling 833-347-8766 (24/7/365). Free and confidential support for FIRST RESPONDERS.**

FST5 was developed in partnership with Common Ground, State of Michigan, and Wayne State University
