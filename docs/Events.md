## Romulus Resident CPR / AED & Gun Safety Initiative, June 1 - July 31
The **Romulus Public Safety Foundation** is sponsoring a hands-only CPR / AED and Gun Safety course for Romulus residents on Sunday, August 3rd. The **Romulus Fire Department** will provide a hands-only overview of CPR and how to use an Automated External Defibrillator (AED), equipping participants with life-saving knowledge in the event of a cardiac emergency. Following that, the **Romulus Police Department** will discuss practical tips for safe firearm storage and household gun safety to help reduce the risk of accidents and promote responsible gun ownership. This informative course is a great opportunity for individuals and families to become more prepared and safety-conscious at home and in the community. <a href="https://romuluspsf.square.site/product/romulus-resident-cpr-aed-gun-safety/5?cs=true&cst=custom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For more information and sign-up - here!</a>

The **Romulus Public Safety Foundation** is a proud sponsor of the **City of Romulus Annual Juneteenth Celebration** on **Saturday, June 21** - a day of reflection, education, unity, and joy.

Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the United States and honors the enduring spirit, culture, and contributions of African Americans throughout history. We're excited to join our neighbors in celebrating freedom, community, and progress at this meaningful event.

Stop by our booth to say hello, learn more about how we support our city's first responders, and enjoy the festivities with us!
