# Our Programs

The Romulus Public Safety Foundation supports a variety of initiatives that benefit and support our dedicated first responders. Our programs are designed to enhance safety, wellness, and engagement between public safety professionals and the public they serve.

## 🚒 First Responder Wellness
We support physical and mental wellness programs for police officers, firefighters, and dispatchers, and their immediate family — including peer support training, wellness check-ins, and professional development resources.

**2025 Mental Health Initiative - Update**

Thanks to the combined efforts of our Police and Fire Departments, and through the support of our Foundation, we're proud to share that <a href="https://fst5.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frontline Strong Together</a> is now an active partner within our public safety divisions.

FST5 is a mental health program that was built specifically for first responders, by first responders. They offer confidential support, peer-to-peer connections, access to culturally competent mental health professionals, and 24 / 7 resources tailored to the realities of first responders.
